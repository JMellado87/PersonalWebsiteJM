        <p>I have always had an profound appreciation for the beauty in the natural landscapes around me. At them same time i have a great respect for people and thoroghly enjoy the company of small or big groups of them. </p> <p>
            I like playing boardgames and video games but I also enjoy down hill mountian biking  and hiking in nature.
            I don't really watch sports but i like playing soccer and frisbee golf. 
            I don't do enough of it but I really like photography, I enjoy it and I belive I have a keen eye for moments and oppertunities. <p> I com from a big family so I am used to talking alot, being one of the oldest boys and in my adult life I have had to do alot of the talking. But recently I have decided to take more active and deliberate path to do more active listening so do not take my silence as not being interested or involved. I am simply giving others the chance to speak first.</p>
